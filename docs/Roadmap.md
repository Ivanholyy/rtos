# [OS Codename] roadmap

The current status and the future of this OS.
A build (`.iso` file) will be released every time a Milestone is completed. The various milestones _might_ be updated over the course of time.

## 3rd Milestone

- GUI
  - [ ]lots of sketches and ideas


## 2nd Milestone

- More filesystem stuff
  - [ ] ISO9660
- Hard drive setup:
    - [ ] FAT32 (boot partition)
    - [ ] EXTx  (system partition)

- [ ] Syscalls
- [ ] ELF loading
- [ ] OS-specific toolchain
- [ ] UNIX/POSIX compatibility layer
    (if someone wants to port `coreutils`, `bash`, whatever)

- [ ] Basic shell
  - [ ] Configuration System (registry)
  - [ ] Enviroment Variables
  - [ ] Input and Ouput syscalls

- [ ] Video modes
  - [ ] Set better screen resolutions other than limine's default
  - [ ] Some kind of graphics API
  - [ ] Oh yeah, DOOM because we have to :3
